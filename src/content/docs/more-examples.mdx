## Transit

Virtual Community offers various transit options—such as bus and bicycles—for agents to commute.

### Run

Run the following script to test the example, where 15 agents will randomly choose different transit options to navigate to different goal places.

```bash
./scripts/run_transit_example.sh
```

## Visualization 

We provide a tool to visualize the simulation ouputs in HTML format. You can run the following command to generate the HTML demo:

```bash
cd tools
python ViCo/tools/make_html_demo.py -d output/<scene>_<config>/<agent_type>
python -m http.server
```
Note that you need a template HTML file `template.html` in the `tools` directory. You can find an example template already provided in `tools/template.html`.
