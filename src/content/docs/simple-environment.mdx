## Simple Environment
Although Virtual Community is designed for simulating large-scale communities in open worlds, we also provide lightweight simulation environments for quick testing and exploration.

## Running a Demo Environment
Several demo configurations for simple environments are available under `ViCo/assets/scenes/demos`.  
To run one of them, use:

```bash
./scripts/run_simple_env.sh
````

You can also modify the `--config_path` in this script to point to other demo configurations.
For higher-quality rendering, add the `--use_luisa_renderer` flag.

## Creating a New Demo Configuration

You can create a new demo configuration by following the examples in `ViCo/assets/scenes/demos`.
Here is one example:

```json
{
    "sim_name": "Simple_agent_num_2",
    "scene": "ViCo/scene/demo/DETROIT_ok/DETROIT_stage2_cut_with_objects_basic.glb",
    "scene_offset": [0.0, 0.0, 26.3],
    "height_field": "ViCo/scene/demo/DETROIT_ok/height_field.npz",
    "agent_names": [
        "Alex Jefferson",
        "Brian Carter"
    ],
    "step": 0,
    "curr_time": "October 1, 2024, 09:00:00",
    "start_time": "October 1, 2024, 09:00:00",
    "agent_poses": [
        [173.0, 6.5, 107.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
        [172.0, 7.5, 107.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    ],
    "num_agents": 2,
    "sec_per_step": 1,
    "agent_skins": [
        "ViCo/avatars/models/mixamo_Alex_Jefferson.glb",
        "ViCo/avatars/models/mixamo_Brian_Carter.glb"
    ],
    "dt_control": [1.0, 1.0],
    "dt_visual_obs": [1.0, 1.0],
    "camera_config": [
        {
            "pos": [175.12438844417848, 5.75085496182845, 108.61468966186943],
            "lookat": [173.12438844417848, 7.75085496182845, 107.61468966186943]
        }
    ],
    "agent_actions": [
        [{"type": "move_forward", "arg1": 1.0}],
        [{"type": "move_forward", "arg1": 1.0}]
    ]
}
```

### Explanation of Fields

* `sim_name`: Unique identifier for the configuration.
* `scene`: Path to the 3D scene (GLB file) or an indoor scene ID from `ViCo/modules/indoor_scenes/scenes` (without the `.json` suffix).
* `scene_offset`: Offset to apply when loading the scene.
* `height_field`: Height field for avatars. Optional if not available.
* `agent_poses`: Initial positions (first 3 dimensions) and rotations (last 3 dimensions, Euler angles).
* `agent_skins`: Agent skins, selectable from `ViCo/avatars/models/`.
* `camera_config`: List of camera configurations for video recording (supports multiple).
* `agent_actions`: Sequence of actions for each agent. Each agent executes its actions in order.
  Format:

  ```json
  {
      "type": "<action_type>",
      "arg1": ...
  }
  ```

### Available Actions

Below is the list of supported action types and their arguments (in parentheses):

* `move_forward` (arg1: distance)
* `teleport` (arg1: \[x, y, z] position)
* `turn_left` (arg1: angle in degrees)
* `turn_right` (arg1: angle in degrees)
* `look_at` (arg1: \[x, y, z] position)
* `sleep`
* `wake`
* `pick` (arg1: 0 = left hand, 1 = right hand; arg2: \[x, y, z] position)
* `put` (arg1: 0 = left hand, 1 = right hand)
* `stand`
* `sit` (arg1: \[x, y, z] position)
* `drink` (arg1: 0 = left hand, 1 = right hand)
* `eat` (arg1: 0 = left hand, 1 = right hand)
* `wait`
* `play_animation` (arg1: animation name, selectable from [motion list](https://github.com/Virtual-Community-AI/virtual-community-ai.github.io/tree/main/src/assets/text/motion.txt))
